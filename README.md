# Evalutate-the-Spire
A deck evaluation program for the game "Slay the Spire."

The idea is to generate an attack score and a defense based on the cards in the deck. I want to ignore relics for the initial version to avoid too much complication. The core concept around attack/defense score is playability. For example, a card might do a lot of damage but if its playability is low, it should not contribute much to the attack score. I have added an text file for ideas on how to evalutate a card's playability.
